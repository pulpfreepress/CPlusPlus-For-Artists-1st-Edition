# CPlusPlus-For-Artists-1st-Edition
Source code examples from the first edition of C++ For Artists: The Art, Philosophy, And Science Of Object-Oriented Programming. Published in 2003 - so this sh*t is old...I used Code Warrior for the projects back in the day. Do they even still make Code Warrior? Anyway, enjoy.
